# Chocolate Bar

A low-profile 50% keyboard, with less ergonomics than expected!

This keyboard uses choc switches. Choc switches are low-profile switches pioneered by Kailh that use a non-MX style stem. This keyboard uses only standard sizes for choc keycaps, being 1u, 1.5u, and 2u

Please note: V2 PCBs are still compatible with V1 cases and plates. The new feature on the V2 PCB, the OLED, cannot be used on V1 plates or cases. V2 cases do not exist yet, that is currently still being worked on.
V2 firmware is similarly unavailable, though the current firmware should work provided you update the pins. This will be updated after the next proto run.
